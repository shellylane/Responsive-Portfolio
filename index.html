        <p class=ptext>
            Hi! I'm Shelly. I am a Fullstack (MERN) Web Developer in the Phoenix, AZ area. I recently finished the
            University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp in December, I am currently working as a teaching assistant for the
            next cohort of the same bootcamp I attended. It has been rewarding to help other students and see their
            growth. I am also working on a freelance project for a company called SSS Recycling.
        </p>
        <p class=ptext>
            I finished a B.S. in Psychology in 2006. Since then I have spent almost 13 years working in the home
            healthcare industry. I would love to find an opportunity where I can use both my healthcare background and
            coding skills.
        </p>

        <p class=ptext>
            During my free time I can be found building fun projects with ReactJS, enjoying the outdoors with my
            husband and three boys,or snuggling with my dog Gracie. I love to read and I am happiest when I am learning
            new things!
        </p>
